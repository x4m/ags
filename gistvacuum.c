	 * already has write lock on the buffer and it will be fully initialized
	 * before we can examine it.  (See also vacuumlazy.c, which has the same
	 * issue.)	Also, we need not worry if a page is added immediately after
	 * we look; the page splitting code already has write-lock on the left
	 * page before it adds a right page, so we must already have processed any
	 * tuples due to be moved into such a page.
